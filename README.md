# dockerfiles-dynamics-nav
Various Dockerfiles for MS Dynamics NAV. 

The idea of this repository is to verify the possibility of running MS Dynamics NAV Server inside Docker container. 
If this will work correctly one can literally build any version (right now supposed for 2016 and 2017) in combination with any Cumulative Update without a need to get messed with the installation process and avoiding all conflicts or limitations when running several CUs parallelly in one machine.
